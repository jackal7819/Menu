## Technologies Used

This project leverages several modern technologies and libraries to deliver a dynamic and responsive web application:

- **React**: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making it easy to manage complex UIs efficiently.

- **React Hooks**: React Hooks, such as `useState`, are used to manage the application's state and component lifecycles, simplifying state management and side effects.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The project utilizes modern JavaScript features, including arrow functions, destructuring, and classes, to write clean and maintainable code.

- **Vite**: Vite is employed as a build tool to enhance the development experience. It offers fast development server and optimized production builds, making the application highly efficient.

- **CSS (Styling)**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style the application. You may have employed CSS frameworks or preprocessors like SCSS to enhance your styling capabilities.

- **Git and Version Control**: Git is used for version control, enabling you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

- **Node.js and npm **: Node.js is used to run JavaScript on the server, while npm manages project dependencies. These tools enable the installation and management of libraries and packages.

- **Responsive Design**: The project incorporates responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices, from desktop to mobile.
